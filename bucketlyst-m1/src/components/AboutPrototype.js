I like building databases, creating games, designing interfaces, and doing \
web development in CS. I have experience working with backend, but Id rather \

is my stronger suit. Aside from CS, some of my hobbies include drawing, playing \
piano, exploring new places, and longboarding. \

learning and trying to live life to the fullest with the time we have, cause \
