### (If you don't have Node JS or React installed, you may need to install those first)

### First, cd to the bucklyst-m1 folder, wherever it's at on your machine

### Then run 'npm start'
If you have everything installed correctly, his shuold open up your local host with the react app running, most likely on port 3000

# IMPORTANT: After you have pulled and have this code in the editor, go to AboutPrototype.js in the src/components folder. Go to where your name is in the array from lines 84-91. 

### Then add in your last name, save, and then push. Jose wants to make sure that everyone can commit code directly from their machine through pushing, he doesn't want us to directly edit the code on the Github website
